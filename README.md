# Shortest Path Finder (Java)

## Overview
A console-based program to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.

## Features
- Accepts **user input** for graph vertices, edges, and weights.
- Calculates **shortest distance** from a given source vertex.
- Displays the **path** from source to each vertex.
- Demonstrates **graph algorithms, recursion, and problem-solving skills**.

## Sample Input
Vertices: 5
Edges: 7
Edges (from to weight):
0 1 10
0 4 5
1 2 1
1 4 2
2 3 4
3 0 7
4 2 9
Source: 0


## How to Run
1. Compile: `javac ShortestPathApp.java`  
2. Run: `java ShortestPathApp`  
3. Enter input as prompted.

## Technologies
- Java
- VS Code
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
